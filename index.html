        <h4>Refer a Friend</h4>
        <p>Nurses, carers and support workers have been referring their friends to us for years because of our dedication to customer service and the flexibility we give our staff. Our workers love keeping the same account manager, compliance manager and payroll team and working with people they know. And what better way for us to “thank you”, than with great rewards. With our “Refer a Friend” incentive we will pay you up to £250 for the nurses and carers
             you refer, once they have worked a minimum number of shifts and they will get a £75 joining bonus.</p>
